# JavaScript Restaurant Page

##### Project 3

#### A Web project using Webpack for JS optimization

## About

This web project simulates a simple landing page for a restaurant while wrapping all of its JS into a simplified file for loading time optimization, thanks to the use of Webpack.

## Details

Its recommended to see this project locally because there are sometimes issues with the CSS.

**Live Page:** [GitHub Hosting](https://fsolm.github.io/JS-restaurant-page/)

This project uses some `npm packages`, though there are only linters so they're not necessary for the project to run.

## Installation

All the necessary files are in the `dist` folder, just open the HTML file in it.

Alternately, if you have `Node.js` installed, you can run the command `$ npm install` to add `Litwick Reys`'s `Live Server` and execute `$ live-server`. If that doesn't work, you can check its docs over [here](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server)

## Known Issues

There are some minor issues with the height of the page, in higher displays it will look kind of short.

Additionally, in the **Contact** section there's a `Google maps` embedded map that'll take some time to load.

## Planned Implementation

None, the goal of this project was completed and it's not necessary to revisit it.
